# Repository for PHY 415 - Fall 2022

You are either in branch _main_ or _fall2022_. The _main_ branch is updated when _fall2022_ is ready for public view.

Here you will find the course materials used in PHY 415 at Michigan State University in the Fall of 2022 as taught by [Danny Caballero](http://dannycab.github.io/). Future iterations of this course will appear in this repository but as different branches.

Once the _main_ brnach is up-to-date, the course site is updated and posted as the _gh-pages_ branch. That branch produces the [public facing website](https://dannycab.github.io/phy415msu/).
