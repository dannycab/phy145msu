    "# Welcome to Mathematical Modeling in Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "PHY 415, called, \"Mathematical Methods for Physicists\" is a course the brings together many of the mathematical approaches that we commonly use in physics and apply them to variety of problems. In this course, we will take a modeling-based approach where we focus on the mathematical descriptions of physical phenomenon and determine what mathematical and analytical approaches are useful in exploring those models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense of the course, please read all the pages associated with our syllabus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* investigate physical systems using a variety of tools and approaches,\n",
    "* construct and document a reproducible process for those investigations,\n",
    "* use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches to answer specific questions in those investigations,\n",
    "* provide evidence of the quality of work using a variety of sources, and\n",
    "* collaborate effectively and contribute to a inclusive learning environment\n",
