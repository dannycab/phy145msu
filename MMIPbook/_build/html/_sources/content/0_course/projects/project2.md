# Project 2

Project 2 will expand on what you have done in Project 1 to include multi-body systems. In this project you will:

1. develop a model of a physical system of two or more bodies,
2. use a Lagrangian analysis to establish your equations of motion and investigations
3. develop a similar analysis to project 1 (phase space, plots, numerical integration, etc)

## What do you need to do?

On Tuesday, we will reflect on the components of what we NOW think is a good model.


## Rubric

Based on our discussion in class, we will change our emphasis for this project.But the rubric from Project 1 will be used again, with different emphasis based on your thinking.
