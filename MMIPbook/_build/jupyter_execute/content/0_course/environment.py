# ## Commitment to an Inclusive Classroom
# 
# I am committed to creating an inclusive classroom - one where you and your classmates
# feel comfortable, intellectually challenged, and able to speak up about your ideas
# and experiences. This means that our classroom, our virtual environments, and our interactions
# need to be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen
# and observe others are central to creating a classroom that is inclusive. I will strive to
# do this and I ask that you do the same. If I can do anything to make the classroom a better
# learning environment for you, please let me know.
# 
# **If you observe or experience behaviors that violate our commitment to inclusivity,
# please let me know as soon as possible.**
# 
# If I violate this principle, please let me know
# or please tell the undergraduate department chair,
# Stuart Tessmer ([tessmer@pa.msu.edu](mailto:tessmer@pa.msu.edu)), who I have informed to tell me about any such incidents
# without conveying student information to me.
# 
# ## Comments on preparation:
# 
# Physics 482 covers material you might have seen before (Many of the topics
# stem from PHY 184/294H material) but at a higher level of conceptual and
# mathematical sophistication.
# 
# Therefore you should expect:
# 
# -   a large amount of material covered quickly.
# -   no recitations, and few examples covered in lecture. Most homework
#     problems are not similar to examples from class.
# -   long, hard homework problems that usually cannot be completed by one
#     individual alone.
# -   challenging projects.
# 
# Physics 482 is a challenging, upper‚Äêdivision physics course. Unlike more
# introductory courses, you are fully responsible for your own learning.
# In particular, you control the pace of the course by asking questions in
# class. I tend to speak quickly, and questions are important to slow down
# the lecture. This means that if you don't understand something, it is
# your responsibility to ask questions. Attending class and the homework
# help sessions gives you an opportunity to ask questions. I am here to
# help you as much as possible, but I need your questions to know what you
# don't understand.
# 
# Physics 482 covers some of the most important physics and mathematical
# methods in the field. Your reward for the hard work and effort will be
# learning important and elegant material that you will use over and over
# as a physics major. Here is what I have experienced, and heard from
# other faculty teaching upper division physics in the past:
# 
# - most students reported spending a minimum of 10 hours per week on the
# homework (!!)
# - students who didn't attend the homework help sessions
# often did poorly in the class.
# - students reported learning a tremendous amount in this class.
# 
# **The course topics that we will cover in Physics 482 are among the
# greatest intellectual achievements of humans. Don't be surprised if you
# have to think hard and work hard to master the material.**
