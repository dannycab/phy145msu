# # Project Rubrics
# 
# ## Preliminary (For first out of class project)
# 
# Our rubric will initially focus on the [core learning goals](goals.md). As we develop expertise in these areas, we might decide to change emphases or focus.
#

# |-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------:|
# | Investigate physical systems                              |          0.30         |
# | Construct and document a reproducible process             |          0.10         |
# | Use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches   |          0.30         |

# I will develop specific rubric elements based on your engagement with the in-class materials on the first couple of class periods. I need to observe where we need the most support initially and that will change the rubric expectations.
