# # Welcome to Mathematical Modeling in Physics
# 
# PHY 415, called, "Mathematical Methods for Physicists" is a course the brings together many of the mathematical approaches that we commonly use in physics and apply them to variety of problems. In this course, we will take a modeling-based approach where we focus on the mathematical descriptions of physical phenomenon and determine what mathematical and analytical approaches are useful in exploring those models.

# ## Learning Objectives
# 
# In this course, you will learn to:
# 
# * investigate physical systems using a variety of tools and approaches,
# * construct and document a reproducible process for those investigations,
# * use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches to answer specific questions in those investigations,
# * provide evidence of the quality of work using a variety of sources, and
# * collaborate effectively and contribute to a inclusive learning environment
