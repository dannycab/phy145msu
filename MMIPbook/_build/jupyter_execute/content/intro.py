# # Welcome to Mathematical Modeling in Physics
# 
# PHY 415, called, "Mathematical Methods for Physicists" is a course the brings together many of the mathematical approaches that we commonly use in physics and apply them to variety of problems. In this course, we will take a modeling-based approach where we focus on the mathematical descriptions of physical phenomenon and determine what mathematical and analytical approaches are useful in exploring those models.

# 
# * This week, we will return to coupled oscillations to set us up for waves. The [reading](2_oscillations/readings-waves) focuses on the 1D Wave Equation. We will likely start that work on Thursday after we finish up with $N$ coupled oscillators.
#     * I will post expanded instructions for project 2 this weekend.
#     * We will have your grades for project 1 done by Monday.

# 
# * This week, we will finish up with [Lagrangian Analysis](2_oscillations/readings-lagrangian-dynamics) and shift back into how that analysis sets us up for modeling
#     * Here are direct links to my handwritten notes on [Coupled Oscillations](https://github.com/dannycab/phy415msu/blob/main/MMIPbook/assets/pdfs/notes/Notes_2_Coupled_Oscillations.pdf) and [Lagrangian Dynamics](https://github.com/dannycab/phy415msu/blob/main/MMIPbook/assets/pdfs/notes/Notes_2_Lagrangian_Dynamics.pdf).
#     * Peruse these notes, there's no reading this week since we are continuing with the same topic.
#     * Our goal this week is making sure you all feel comfortable setting up a Lagrangian and doing the analysis of it
# * [Project 2](0_course/projects/project2) is posted with minor details. We will discuss at the end of Tuesday's class what we think a good model is now.

# ## Learning Objectives
# 
# In this course, you will learn to:
# 
# * investigate physical systems using a variety of tools and approaches,
# * construct and document a reproducible process for those investigations,
# * use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches to answer specific questions in those investigations,
# * provide evidence of the quality of work using a variety of sources, and
# * collaborate effectively and contribute to a inclusive learning environment
