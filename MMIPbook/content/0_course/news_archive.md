**7 October 2022**

* This week, we will return to coupled oscillations to set us up for waves. The [reading](2_oscillations/readings-waves) focuses on the 1D Wave Equation. We will likely start that work on Thursday after we finish up with $N$ coupled oscillators.
    * I will post expanded instructions for project 2 this weekend.
    * We will have your grades for project 1 done by Monday.


**2 October 2022**

* This week, we will finish up with [Lagrangian Analysis](2_oscillations/readings-lagrangian-dynamics) and shift back into how that analysis sets us up for modeling
    * Here are direct links to my handwritten notes on [Coupled Oscillations](https://github.com/dannycab/phy415msu/blob/main/MMIPbook/assets/pdfs/notes/Notes_2_Coupled_Oscillations.pdf) and [Lagrangian Dynamics](https://github.com/dannycab/phy415msu/blob/main/MMIPbook/assets/pdfs/notes/Notes_2_Lagrangian_Dynamics.pdf).
    * Peruse these notes, there's no reading this week since we are continuing with the same topic.
    * Our goal this week is making sure you all feel comfortable setting up a Lagrangian and doing the analysis of it
* [Project 2](0_course/projects/project2) is posted with minor details. We will discuss at the end of Tuesday's class what we think a good model is now.
