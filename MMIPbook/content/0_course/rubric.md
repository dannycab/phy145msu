# Project Rubrics

## Preliminary (For first out of class project)

Our rubric will initially focus on the [core learning goals](goals.md). As we develop expertise in these areas, we might decide to change emphases or focus.

| Goal                                                      | Fractional Importance |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------:|
| Investigate physical systems                              |          0.30         |
| Construct and document a reproducible process             |          0.10         |
| Use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches   |          0.30         |
| Provide evidence of the quality of their work             |          0.10         |
| Collaborate effectively                                   |          0.20         |

I will develop specific rubric elements based on your engagement with the in-class materials on the first couple of class periods. I need to observe where we need the most support initially and that will change the rubric expectations.
