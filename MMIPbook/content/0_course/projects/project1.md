# Project 1

Project 1 will focus on the the topic of ordinary differential equations in physics. Differential equations are often how we describe nature because nature often changes continously (quantum mehcanics not withstanding). We focused in class on the harmonix oscilaltor and it's variants. Your job is to develop a project that investigates some nonlinear differential equation of your choosing. My expectation is that this ODE is nonlinear, at least 2nd order or two coupled 1st order equations, and that is of interest to you personally or professionally. I will provide a list of potential candidates.

## What do you need to do?

Think about the ways we have explored things in class. This is meant to be an introduction to making a project, so my expectation is that the projects will get more involved and interesting over time. That is, as you learn how to do things, you will apply new ideas and do more exploration on your own. We will also reflect on our project rubric and make changes to it as you get more experience and can do more cool things.

But for this first project, I have a list of tasks that you have experienced in class:

* Describe the differential equation.
    - what is it
    - what does it model
    - what assumptions and limitations are baked into it
* Investigate it analytically as best you can
    - Take limits on the nonlinear aspects
    - Investigate approximate behaviors
    - Make claims about what should happen in different regimes (based on limits)
* Develop a computational investigation to compliment the analytics
    - Create a phase space diagram
    - Describe qualitatively important behaviors and regimes in which they occur
        - Compare to your analytical work
    - Compute trajectories in the space and describe the evolution
* Produce visualizations of you work
    - Make graphs that are labeled and titled appropriately for your claims
    - Add mathematics to the notebook is you see fit ($LaTeX$, handwritten, typed are all ok)
* Document your work
    - We should be able to run your notebooks and get exactly what you want us to
    - Comment everything
