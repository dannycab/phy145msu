# Project 5

You have learned to model a variety of physical systems using analytical and numerical tools. We will not have completed enough study of randomness before project 5 is due, so you will instead develop a project of your choosing that meets the following criteria:

1. Is of interest to you and asks clear questions of the system you plan to investigate.
2. Makes use of two approaches, models, analysis techniques that we developed in class to make sense of these systems (think: Phase space, Lagrangian Analysis, Normal Modes, Matrix Analysis, The Eigenvalue Problem, etc.).
3. (OR) makes use of one of the techniques from class and something new you want to learn (e.g., Relaxation methods, wave modeling, curve fitting)

You may choose to:

1. start a new project
2. revisit and revise an old project
3. combine two individual projects into something more complete
4. ask me if something sounds like it fits with the plan.

## Rubric

We will use the same project rubric.
