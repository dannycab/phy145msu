    "PHY 415, called, \"Mathematical Methods for Physicists\" is a course the brings together many of the mathematical approaches that we commonly use in physics and apply them to variety of problems. In this course, we will take a modeling-based approach where we focus on the mathematical descriptions of physical phenomenon and determine what mathematical and analytical approaches are useful in exploring those models.\n",
