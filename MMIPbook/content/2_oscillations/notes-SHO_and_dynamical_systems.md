# Notes: 02 - The SHO and Phase Portraits

These is the summary of the PHY 415 class period on 01 Sept 22. If I missed anything, [send me an message](https://phy415fall2022.slack.com/) on Slack and I will add it here. -DC

Today, we worked with the simple harmonic oscillator's general solution to find particular solutions and remind ourselves how that all works. We used that to talk about 2nd order systems a bit more generally, which is the focus of your first project (a 2nd order ODE of your choosing). We also discussed phjase portraits and what they buy us. We will investigate them further with more real systems like the pendulum that can go over the top and the damped oscillator.

## Resources

Here are scans (sorry for the potato quality) of four sections of four books (that you can look over at my office and take photos) that are useful for our study of the SHO and will help you with your project ideas and plans.

- [Boas, Mathematical Methods, Sec 8.5](../../assets/pdfs/scans/Boas_ODEs_8.5.pdf)
    - This section goes into all the math (in general) for ODEs like the SHO, which are second order ($\ddot{x}$), have constant coefficients (e.g., no explicit time dependence of the coefficients), and that are "homogenous" (i.e., have no constant terms or explicit functions of time).
    - If you want to be reminded about all the ODE things, it's a good read.
